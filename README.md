# Muffy
Muffy is a Discord bot that temporarily restricts the channels you're allowed to use by **deleting your messages** as soon as you try to send them.

set your timezone and give a time range (e.g. 9:00am-5:00pm), and Muffy will wait until your local time is within that range, then stop you cold!

[add Muffy to your server here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=806929919929614346&permissions=76816&scope=bot), then type `@Muffy help` to get started!
